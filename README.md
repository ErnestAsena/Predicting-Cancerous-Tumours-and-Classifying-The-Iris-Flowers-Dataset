# Predicting-Cancerous-Tumours-and-Classifying-The-Iris-Flowers-Dataset
In this repository, one notebook goes through classifying a tumour as either being malignant or benign based off a number of features. In the second notebook, I attempt to get the right class of an Iris flower based on its features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. The Models used are Support Vector machines since these are more appropriate for these kinds of analysis.
